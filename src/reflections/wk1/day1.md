# 1 - Git 101


## **Why do developers use Git?** 
This version control system allows us as developers to revert to an older version of our code if needed. 

In the instance that a recent version has errors, we are able to focus on the exact changes in the new version to help pinpoint the error or to revert to the previous version. 

It's also incredibly important when working in parallel with other developers as well as when you consider requirements for projects can change.


## **Benefits of having multiple branches**
Parallel developments are easily separated and later merged by using multiple branches.

## **Difference between Git and GitHub**
Git is a version control system while Github is a cloud-based remote repository.
