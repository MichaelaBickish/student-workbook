# 5 - Weekly Reflections 

### *Positives*
At the end of the first week, I'm feeling very positive and happy. The days are going by really quickly. 

I had fun building a mock site on Wednesday even though I didn't know the mobile design tips quite yet. Thursday, I worked with Ethan who has a similiar experience background as myself. We ended up working super well together, had fun building a clone of John Deere and felt like we did a good job. We both agreed on the power of collaboration and probably high-fived like ten times during our project. Small wins!

### *Struggles*
My biggest struggle is feeling like I'm a slow-ish learner. I understand the concepts I'm learning and know it will take time to recall the small things and quickly knowing where to look for solutions.

My next biggest struggle is asking for help. I will work to get past this since we will be moving so quickly.

I am trying to get home and have a couple hours to review anything/prepare for the next day. As long as I have time outside my checkpoint project, I will spend this weekend reviewing everything. I've realized how important the nightly journals are to prepare for the next day's topic.

### *In Conclusion*
Mostly, I'm enjoying learning and happy to be feeling that software developing is fun. Just trying to prepare myself for any stress waves headed my way!!!
