## **What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?**
My top favorite design tip is using fewer borders and if it seems like there should be a border, to instead use a box shadow or two different background colors. To me, thse options give a much cleaner uncluttered feel to a page.

## **Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.**
I think referencing <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/getting-started/introduction/">the Bootstrap website</a>  and <a href="material.io">Material Design</a> are great places to start for design insight.

## **How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?**
I think good design keeps people engaged on the page avoiding information overload. Excessive noise or clutter on the page will cause a user to become disinterested or confused. With user's short attention spans, a simple and clutter-free design will keep them engaged and interested.
