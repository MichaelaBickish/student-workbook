## **What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?**
A pseudo class is a keyword added to a selector that will allow you to style a certain part of the element. 

I think a couple of the common ones will be: using :hover to style when the mouse hovers over an element and :visited to style a link that's been visited by the user.

## **What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?**
In CSS, it determines which rule applies if multiple rules are targeting an element and property on that element.

The use of specificity will allow me to apply very specific styling to elements I choose. It will allow creative styling.

## **What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?**
The !important feature overrides any other style declaration so you wouldn't even be able to use specificity to your advantage in styling. It would limit your ability to style elements.
