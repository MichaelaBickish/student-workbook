# 4 - Wire-framing



## **What is the purpose of wire-framing?**
Wire-framing is the starting point of a product life cycle.
First, it keeps the concept user-focused by getting feedback from users, starts conversations with stakeholders and generates ideas between designers. 

Second, wire-frames clarify and define site features by letting designers or stakeholders visualize how everything will work together.

Lastly, with wire-frames being easy and cheap to create, they encourage honest first impressions because with the core page layout exposed, flaws and pain points are more easily identified and fixed earlier than later in the design process.

## **What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?**
Low fidelity wire-frames are a rough draft of a visual representation and helps get an idea to paper. 

Mid fidelity wire-frames are a more accurate representation, including more detail, and are usually created digitally. They are also helpful in a product's early stages.

High fidelity wire-frames are a much more polished and detail-inclusive representation. They're helpful for the exploring and documenting complex concepts later in the design cycle.

## **Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?.**
Yes! Functioning as a designer's blueprint, wire-frames help organize ideas, ensure consistency, and clarify how the final product should be laid out. In short, wire-frames save a lot of time and money in the long run.
