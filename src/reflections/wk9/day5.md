Afternoon Project: Working on Capstone


## *Weekly Reflections*

One thing I noticed as product owner is how easy it can be to run past break times or forget to hold a stand up. I am a pretty organized person and noticed how easily things can get a bit sloppy if you don't stay on track with your sprint reviews and trello board. Overall, our team did well with our Trello board and meetings, though. It was an interesting experience to have someone on the team that had a hard time collaborating. The entire team had to adapt to that and I had to make sure I was trying to openly communicate about the ongoing issue.
