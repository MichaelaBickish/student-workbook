Afternoon Project: Working on Capstone

Reflect on your capstone project so far and answer the following questions

## *What technologies and principles are you using in your project?*
We are using Vue3, Javascript, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js, Mongodb & Mongoose, Auth0.

## *What went well so far?*
Our planning went well. Our daily work has gone well and we've kept progressing even with hitting roadblocks.

## *What would you do differently? Why?*
There is one person that the group is having a hard time with. I really am at a loss and don't know what I could've done differently to help the group and help that person. In spite of this issue, I feel like the project has still kept progressing. The atmosphere just hasn't always been the best.
