Read Working In a Professional Environment > A Beginner's Guide to SSL: What it is & Why it makes your website more secure and answer the following questions

## *What is an SSL certificate?*
Small data files that cryptographically establish an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browser remain private.

## *What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?*
-Extended Validation (EV): shows the padlock, HTTPS, business name, and business country in the address bar to prevent being mistaken for a spam site. These are the most expensive SSLs to obtain, but valuable in showing the legitimacy of the domain from the address bar.

-Organization Validated (OV SSL): verifies an organization and domain validation are real. They offer a medium level of encryption and are obtained in two steps. 1: the CA would verify who owns the domain and 2: if the organization is operating legally.

-Domain Validation (DV): offers a low level of encryption shown as a green padlock next to the URL in the address bar. This is the quickest validation you can receive, and just a few company documents are needed to apply.

-Wildcard SSL Certificates are in the "domain and subdomain number" category. They ensure that if you buy a certificate for one domain, you can use that same certificate for subdomains. An option like this is cheaper than obtaining multiple SSL certificates for a number or domain.

-Also known as Multi-domain SSL certificates, Unified Communications certificates (UCCs) allow multiple domain names to be on the same certificate. UCCs were created to bridge communication between a single server and browser but have since expanded to include multiple domain names by the same owner. A UCC in the address bar shows a padlock to display verification. They can also be considered an EV SSL if they are configured to show that green text, padlock, and home country. The only difference is the number of domain names associated with this certificate.Multi-domain SSL certificates cover up to 100 domain names.

-A Single Domain SSL protects one domain. The thing to remember about this certificate is that you can't use it to protect subdomains or a completely different domain.

## *What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?*
SSL is part of Google's search ranking algorithm- SEO benefits.

Users will feel more secure in seeing the padlock / https in the url.

Your users/clients won't have their info stolen on your company's site.
