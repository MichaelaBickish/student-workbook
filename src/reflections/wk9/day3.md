## *How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?*
Meetings that take up a lot of time during the work day can start to impact the progress of a small team. Taking communication to something like slack can reduce the time spent in meetings and increase the small team's time to write code all while still having good communication.

Developers on a smaller team may also have the chance to broaden their involvement in the project and "take up the slack" and share the additional responsibilities amongst the team, getting to work in areas maybe they normally wouldn't if they were on a larger team.

## *Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.*
1 sprint at a time will result in the best possible quality of code. If more than one sprint is running in parallel, you run into the unnatainable triangle.

## *What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?*
