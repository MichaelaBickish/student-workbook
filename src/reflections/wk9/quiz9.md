# Working in a Professional Environment

**1.** What is Inheritance?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Inheritance is the ability of one object to acquire some/all properties of another object.
```
**2.** What is the `Singleton` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. 
The singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. Sometimes we need to have only one instance of our class for example a single DB connection shared by multiple objects as creating a separate DB connection for every object may be costly. 

The Singleton pattern disables all other means of creating objects of a class except for the special creation method. This method either creates a new object or returns an existing one if it has already been created. Use the Singleton pattern when you need stricter control over global variables.
```
**3.** What is the `Observer` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically.
```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.
```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface. The Factory Method pattern is generally used in the following situations:
A class cannot anticipate the type of objects it needs to create beforehand.
A class requires its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
You want to localize the logic to instantiate a complex object.
 
 the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created
```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
In order to be able to decide when an activity from the Sprint Backlog is completed, the Definition of Done (DoD) is used. It is a comprehensive checklist of necessary activities that ensure that only truly done features are delivered, not only in terms of functionality but in terms of quality as well.
```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
-As a manager, I want to be able to understand my colleagues progress, so I can better report our sucess and failures.

-As a user,  I want to invite my friends, so we can enjoy this service together.
