# Week 11 | Day 4 Daily Journal

Afternoon Project: 

## *Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.*
I have learned so much during my time in this course. I have made really good friends. I had the privilege of being a part of a really fun class. There are so many positives to my experience at codeworks and I'm thankful I got to attend this course. I know for a fact it's changed the trajectory of my future. It is just crazy how fast it flew by! I enjoyed my interactions with codeworks staff and appreciated everyone's teachings.

I feel super nervous and scared for the final! There are still a lot of things I feel pretty iffy on. I will try to map my work out by using the SCRUM methods on a trello board to get through my final project. 

I'm concerned about my knowledge retention as things went really fast (too fast for me, personally) but am looking forward to continuing my coding, reviewing and ongoing learning at my own pace after it's over while looking for employment. I found it was very hard for me to study/continue working on current day's work projects when needing to do daily journal, career homework, and watch videos on current topic. I felt the biggest challenge was not having time to review the content before moving on to something new.
