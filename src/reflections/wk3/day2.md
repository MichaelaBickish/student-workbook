Read Advancing with JS > Encapsulation in JavaScript and answer the following questions

## *What is the purpose of Encapsulation?*
Help prevent bugs, keep code clean and organized. Reduce spaghetti code, prevent reusing variable names that can lead to bugs/unpredictable behavior.

## *What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?*
The underscore was used as an internal property. Internal properties can change. And with that, this can lead to breaking changes.

## *How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?*
