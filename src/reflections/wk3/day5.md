# Week 3, day 5 | 4/2/21

This week was a lot. I feel like I have a basic working understanding of MVC pattern. What's hard is that I'm feeling I don't have enough time to tackle the extra review tasks I want to be doing like making flashcards, reviewing my notes, & finishing the video courses. I completed my ck pt 3 and ready or not for week 4!
