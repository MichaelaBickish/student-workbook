## *What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?*
- exercising the skill that is logic-based creativity
- creating a plan and series of steps that need to happen gives you a clear outline. This will give you better quality code.
- if you stop to think of the *several* possible solutions to your problem, you can find the most efficient one and then get to work.

## *How do you find answers when you are stuck?*
Use resources available to you to try and discover the answer for yourself. If you still can't find the answer, don't waste too much time being stuck and ask for support/help.

## *From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?*
- think of many possible solutions to the problem and then go with the most efficient (for better quality code)
- stop wasting time by not googling and researching the problem/solution **before** you get started on writing it.
- encapsulation. Group like things together, like utility classes. Don't be a noob. Same goes for using the correct data structures. Maps should be used for managing records. Plus they're just faster than lists when looking up records.
