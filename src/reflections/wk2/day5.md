# 5 | 3/26/2021 *Weekly Reflections*

 This week went by fast and I learned so much stepping into javascript. I feel that I need to use tutor sessions. I won't make that mistake again! There is a lot of information coming at me and I feel like my brain can only take in so much. 

 I love the afternoon projects, I feel like that's where info learned gets really stuck into my memory.
