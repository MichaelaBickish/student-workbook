Afternoon Project:

## *What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.*
**1** console.log() - can help you see when & where something is happening.

**2** 

## *Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML? *
Elements tab. You can see view each element in detail. It can be helpful when debugging because you can directly manipulate the page and see the results instantly. This can provide quicker solutions instead of having to save, refresh, etc.

## *Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?*
Using the source tab debugger and the tools to walk through your code line by line. (similiar to using the debugger keyword at the top of your js code block).

The dev tools can help locate your bug much faster than trying to make changes and save/refresh.
