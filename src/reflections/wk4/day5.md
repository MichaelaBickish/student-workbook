Week 4 | Sunday 4/11/2021 | Daily Journal


This week was tough for me when my afternoon projects weren't going well. I learn best hands on and when my projects weren't working out, I started feeling really nervous about my weekend project. There's something about having more time and working at home on the weekend where it comes together for me. I still need to review a lot of the concepts from week 4 but am happy my checkpoint came together really well!
