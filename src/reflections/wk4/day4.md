Read Asynchronous Code > What is REST and answer the following questions

## *What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?*
It stands for Representational State Transfer.

A restful web app exposes info about itself in the form of information about the resources it holds. It enables the client to take action on those resources, like create new resources or edit existing resources.

A rest set of constraints makes an API easier to use & discover.

## *What does Stateless mean?*
The server doesn't remember anything about the user who uses the API. It doesn't remember any past requests, which resources the user of the API requested before, etc.

## *What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?*
Urls should include nouns, not verbs. Use plural nouns only for consistency. Use HTTP methods to operate on the resources. Use HTTP response status codes to represent the outcome of operations on resources.
