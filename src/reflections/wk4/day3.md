Read Asynchronous Code > Async and Await and answer the following questions

## *What is the purpose of Async/Await?*
They are built on promises. They solve the callback hell problem. 

## *What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?*
you prepend the code with 'await'.


## *What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?*
Async functions make the code look like it's synchronous, but it's asynchronous and non-blocking behind the scenes. Easier to read. Easier debugging because async/await looks like it's just synchronous code to the compiler.
