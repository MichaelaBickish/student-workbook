## *Why is communication on a small team important?*
A smaller team may need to work harder to deliver a project by a deadline. This is why effective communication is so important. Clear and concise communication keeps a small team on the same page and moving forward with the goals of the project.

## *What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?*
Members should be open to broadening their involvement in the project by possibly learning a new skill that will help them share responsibility in another area of the project.

## *What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?*
