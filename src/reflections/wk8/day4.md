Afternoon Project: Capstones

Read Working In a Professional Environment > Testing in Vue and answer the following questions

## *What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?*
Unit Testing- allows you to test individual units of code in isolation. The purpose is to provide confidence in their code. With meaningful tests, you have confidence that as code is refactored your application will remain functional and stable.

Component Testing- component testing frameworks were created to give users the ability to do this in a reliable way while also providing Vue-specific conveniences such as integrations for Vuex, Vue Router, and other Vue plugins.

End-To-End Testing- provide coverage on what is arguably the most important aspect of an application: what happens when users actually use your applications. E2E tests validate all of the layers in your application. This not only includes your frontend code, but all associated backend services and infrastructure that are more representative of the environment that your users will be in.

## *What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?*
As a new developer, unit testing would be most helpful to me as it would grow my experience and confidence in the code I'm writing and I can be sure that each unit is correct when I move on to the next.

## *What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?*
End to end testing seems more vague and less specific since it's testing the overall infrastructure of the entire application. As a new developer, I would need to gain experience with unit testing first.
