Afternoon Project: Capstones

Read Working In a Professional Environment > Unit Testing and answer the following questions

## *What is Software Development Testing?*
Testing pieces of software (by units that have a single responsibility) in order to catch as many edge cases as possible, write better code, and catch more errors before it's sent to QA.

## *What are the benefits of Testing in software development?*
I can infer that testing would expand a developer's problem-solving skills, as you would begin to think of more edge cases off the top of your head. It helps you write better code. Errors can be pinpointed when testing in development vs QA testing a huge parcel of code before deployment.

## *What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?*
It could possibly take some time to write tests especially if you're not seasoned at writing tests yet.
