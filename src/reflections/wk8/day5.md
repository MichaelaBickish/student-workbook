Afternoon Project: Capstones

## *Weekly Reflections (Optional)*
Working on capstones this week has been fun. From working on my idea which I thought of before my cohort started to being product owner, this is a really great experience. Our team dynamic is interesting and hasn't been without struggles but we continued to move forward in our project and are learning how to develop as part of team as well as continue growing our understanding of building out a full stack app. I'm excited to see how the next week progresses.
