Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > Using Nested Routes in Vue.js and answer the following questions

## *What is a nested route?*
children routes of a parent route inside the router file.


## *When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)*
I could think of so many instances you would use nested routes. One being when you click on a product on an ecommerce site to visit the product page, there would be more routes that might take you to pages like return policy, faq, etc.


## *Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?*
Yes this would be used when you're trying to access particular data like a user photo, user comments, or anything specific to a user.
