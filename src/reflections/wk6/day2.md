Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > How to use Props in Vue and answer the following questions

## *What are props?*
Data passed from a parent component to a child component.

## *What are props used for?*
It's how we pass variables and other information around between different components. We pass props to another component, and that component can then use that value.

## *Where can props be used or accessed?*
Inside templates, methods, computed props, and other js used in the component.
