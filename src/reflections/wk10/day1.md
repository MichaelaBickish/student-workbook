Read Foundations of C# > C# Data Types and answer the following questions

## *What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?*
In C#, these data types are categorized based on how they store their value in the memory:
Value type
Reference type
Pointer type

## *What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?*
A value type holds a data value in its own memory space. The variables of these data types directly contain values.

## *In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?*
A reference type doesn't store the value in it's own memory space like a value type. it stores the address or the pointer to where it's value can be found.
