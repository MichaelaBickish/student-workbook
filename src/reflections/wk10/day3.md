Afternoon Project: https://github.com/MichaelaBickish/csknightcastles

Read Foundations of C# > C# Enum's and answer the following questions

## *What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?*
Enums are strongly typed constants. They are essentially unique types that allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values.  In the C# tradition, they are strongly typed. That means an enum of one type may not be implicitly assigned to an enum of another type, though the underlying value of their members is the same. Along the same lines, integral types and enums are not implicitly interchangeable

When you are using a set of related numbers in a program. It will make a program more readable and type-safe. 

## *How can you modify an Enum?*
You can specify a different base if you want it to have a different type than the default int.
You can set the value of an enum member.


## *How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)*
I don't believe I've used enums. If you ere getting input in the form of an integer from a user.
