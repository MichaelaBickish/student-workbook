Read Dotnet WebAPI's > Welcome to SQL, and answer the following questions

## *In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?*
Rows are complete objects. Columns are specific properties.

## *Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called characters with the values name, age, description as strings, and an int id.*
CREATE TABLE Characters
name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
age VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
id int NOT NULL

## *What is the difference between the following statements: DELETE FROM table_name; DROP TABLE table_name;*
When using the DELETE FROM command, you must give it a condition WHERE, to delete something specific off the table. The DROP TABLE will delete the entire table (danger zone.)
