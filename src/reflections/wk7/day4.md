# Week 7 | Day 4 Daily Journal

Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

## *Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?*
My partner and I implemented JS documentation. I think this will be helpful when we go back to review our project and edit it as well. 

## *What went well?*
We were both similar in our confidence of our knowledge. We had similar struggles. We worked really well together. When I was discouraged, my partner pulled me up and I did the same for her. When we had small wins and understood even some small things a little better, it was really encouraging and felt awesome!!


## *What would you do differently?*
We worked better with my partner on the laptop and me guiding. When we switched, we didn't maintain the same rhythm. I had a hard time thinking as clear when I was on the computer. This is something I obviously need to work on. I feel like the pressure of coding with someone beside me made me freeze up a little. Practicing on a few more projects should really improve this for me.
