## *Final Checkpoint*
On Monday, I fixed many of my server issues for keeps and vaults. The biggest issue was that the creatorId was required on the table as not null and in my sql statement in the repository, I was not passing it in as a value. As well as a couple logic rules I missed. But it felt great to see a lot more of my tests passing. 

I felt like I was getting behind so I moved on to the client. I built out my home page, keep component, keep modal component, rendered all keeps in masonry layout and started working on profile page.
