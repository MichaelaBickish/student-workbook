# Week 12 | Day 2 Daily Journal

## *Final Checkpoint*

Today was a really good and productive day. I started building out my client. I built profile page, built a createKeep and createVault modal. I fixed my get profile keeps in server. I can create and delete keeps on my client. I built out my keep modal. And worked on other small details on my client. I felt really happy with my progress today!
