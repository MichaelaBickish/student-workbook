# Week 12 | Day 3 Daily Journal

## *Final Checkpoint*
Today was rough. I was stuck on trying to figure out why my getVaultbyProfile wasn't working. I didn't do well at time boxing today or asking for help. I finally got help and it turned out to be one of two things. On my table, I didn't have a default for the bool isPrivate. This wouldn't have been an issue if I was passing it through my sql statement in repository, which I wasn't doing. I updated my table to have the default of 0. This was super frustrating but once I got past it, I felt SO much better!! 

So when I got home, I was able to move forward and render vault data to my client. I moved on to start working on vaultkeeps. I can post them but am running in to an error on passing an ID.

At this point, I think I am not passing about 5 postman tests out of 84. My goal tomorrow is to get them fixed before noon so I can focus fully on client!
